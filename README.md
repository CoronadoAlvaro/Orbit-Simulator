# Orbitas - An orbit visualization tool

Orbitas is a software for orbit visualization and simulation developed by Alvaro Coronado and Nerea Galvez.

## Features
- **Interactive Interface**: Obitas provides an interactive interface that allows users to input various orbital parameters.
- **Real-time Visualization**: Users can instantly visualize the orbital trajectories of spacecraft based on the input parameters.
- **Earth Rotation Consideration**: The software incorporates Earth's rotation into the orbital propagator, offering more accurate simulations.
- **Educational and Analytical Tool**: Ideal for educational purposes and space enthusiasts.
- **Full orbit display**: Allows to display orbits for the entirety of the period, contrary to what source WorldWind offers.

## Installation & Setup

1 - **Import the java project to your desired java IDE.**

This project includes the source code of the software and it also imports the needed packages for dependencies.

2 - **Run GUI.java**

This will launch an intuitive GUI for you to start displaying the desired orbits.

## Usage

- Click on "New Orbit" to add a new orbit with custom parameters.
- Click on "Erase Orbit" to remove an existing orbit from the visualization.
- Click on "Start Simulation" to begin the orbit simulation.

## Dependencies

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher.
- PATRIUS (CNES).
- WorldWind (NASA).
