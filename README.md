# Orbitas - An orbit visualization tool

Orbitas is a software for orbit visualization and simulation developed by Alvaro Coronado and Nerea Galvez.

## Features
- **Interactive Interface**: Obitas provides an interactive interface that allows users to input various orbital parameters such as semi-major axis, eccentricity, inclination, and more.
- **Real-time Visualization**: Users can instantly visualize the orbital trajectories of satellites and spacecraft based on the input parameters.
- **Earth Rotation Consideration**: The software incorporates Earth's rotation into the orbital propagator, offering more accurate simulations.
- **Convenient Conversion**: Input semi-major axis in kilometers and automatically convert it to meters for precise calculations.
- **Customization Options**: Customize orbit names and choose from different color schemes to distinguish between multiple orbits.
- **Educational and Analytical Tool**: Ideal for educational purposes and space enthusiasts.
